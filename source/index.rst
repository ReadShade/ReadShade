Welcome to ReadShade
====================

ReadShade is a documentation site designed with simplicity and neutrality in mind. We aim to provide a straightforward and accessible platform for everyone to contribute and share knowledge. We've removed unnecessary complexity and barriers, ensuring that anyone can join our community.

Striving for Neutrality
-----------------------

We strive to remain neutral in our approach, avoiding conflict of interest.

Simple to Contribute
--------------------

We want to make it easy for anyone to contribute to ReadShade, regardless of their technical background. We've chosen Python and Sphinx as our core technologies. You can start creating and editing documentation quickly with just these two tools. There is no need to worry about complicated setup or configuration - install Python and Sphinx, and you're ready to go.
