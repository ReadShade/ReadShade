Important Notes
---------------

When you start the game, you might need to set your main monitor to the Simulated Reality Display. If you don't, the game might not pick the right screen, and you'll see a black screen.

Also, make sure the game runs at the correct resolution for your 3D display. If the resolution is too low, the image might look stretched or blurry.
