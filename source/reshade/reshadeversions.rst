ReShade and You
===============

Introduction
------------

Picking the right ReShade version can be tricky, but we're here to help. This guide will show you how to choose the best ReShade version for what you need.

Am I going to play online or offline?
-------------------------------------

This is an important question because it helps you decide which ReShade version to use. If you're playing an online game, you should use the **add-on version**. This version has **Network Detection** turned off. You can download it from the `official ReShade website <https://reshade.me/>`_ by scrolling to the bottom and clicking the second button.

Keep in mind that the add-on version isn't always necessary. If you're playing a single-player game, the regular ReShade version is fine. You can also download it from the same website, but click the first button this time.

Do I need a special version of ReShade for the game?
----------------------------------------------------

Sometimes, you might need a specific ReShade version for a certain game. For example, `this version of ReShade <https://discord.com/channels/305472403977404416/1160012733652148274/1221669091870244954>`_ is made to work with *Dragon's Dogma 2* along with *REFramework*.

If you're playing a single-player game but need an add-on, you can download the ReShade version that supports add-ons from the `official website <https://reshade.me/>`_. This version works with almost all add-ons, including those found `here <https://discord.com/channels/305472403977404416/1081018051526406195>`_.

Where can I get an older version of ReShade?
--------------------------------------------

If you need an older ReShade version, you have a few options. For versions 3.0.0 and earlier:

#. You can download it directly from the ReShade website: `https://reshade.me/downloads/ReShade_Setup_x.x.x.exe`
#. For versions 5.0.0 and later, use `this link <https://reshade.me/downloads/ReShade_Setup_6.1.1_Addon.exe>`_.

Alternative Method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the version you need isn't on the website anymore, try the `ReShade Repository <https://www.mediafire.com/folder/8ar1jhh1809cl/ReShade_Repository>`_ or `this Mega.nz link <https://mega.nz/#!5eRxTCLZ!DuHO3dqJgZU4TJ5WP9H-eAJVPOJvDFa3U6hyypQkt5A>`_.

.. note::

    You might need an older ReShade version for some games, like *Fallout: New Vegas*, *Fallout 3*, or *The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion*.

I want to play *Elden Ring*. It's an online game with EAC. Can I do this?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, you can play *Elden Ring* with ReShade. The game's creators allow ReShade, so you can use the add-on version. However, not all games with EAC will work with ReShade. For example, *Lords of the Fallen* won't start with any ReShade version, and you'll need to turn off EAC to use it. If you do turn off EAC, use the add-on version of ReShade.
