Disabling DLSS Frame Generation
===============================

Introduction
------------

This guide shows two ways to turn off DLSS Frame Generation, which can sometimes make games crash. The first way turns it off for all games on Windows, and the second shows how to turn it off for just one game.

.. admonition:: Note

   You don't need to do this if you have an Intel or AMD graphics card.

Method 1: Global Disable
------------------------

To turn off DLSS Frame Generation for all games, follow these steps:

Step-by-Step Instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. **Access Display Settings:** Go to :guilabel:`Display Settings` on your Windows computer.

#. **Restart Your PC:** Restart your computer for the changes to take effect. This should turn off Frame Generation everywhere.

Method 2: Game-Specific Disable
-------------------------------

We'll use **Ghost Runner 2** as an example here. Most games will have a similar process.

To turn off DLSS Frame Generation for a specific game, follow these steps:

Step-by-Step Instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. **Locate the nvngx_dlssg.dll File:** Look for a file named :file:`nvngx_dlssg.dll`. In this example, it's in the `Streamline <https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx/streamline>`_ folder:
