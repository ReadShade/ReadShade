Apply the Shader in ReShade
===========================

#. Launch your game with ReShade enabled.
#. Open the ReShade overlay (usually by pressing the :kbd:`Home` key).
#. Go to the :guilabel:`Home` tab. You should see :file:`MyGrayscale.fx` in the list of shaders.
#. Check the box next to :guilabel:`MyGrayscaleEffect` to enable it. Your game screen should now appear in grayscale!
