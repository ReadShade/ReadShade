This section provides detailed guides and information related to various hardware setups and configurations that enhance the gaming and visual experience, particularly in conjunction with ReShade and Depth3D.

Key topics include:

- **WibbleWobble**: An introduction to WibbleWobble, a ReShade add-on that delivers an immersive, VR-like gaming experience. It details how to spread a single game view across multiple monitors with head tracking, supporting both monoscopic and stereoscopic (including Frame Sequential 3D) modes, and custom fields of view. Guides are provided for setting up WibbleWobble with:

  - **Frame Sequential (Monitor)**: Instructions on building and configuring an IR Emitter (IR Blaster) using an Arduino, breadboard, IR LED, and 3D glasses for Frame Sequential 3D on monitors. It includes wiring diagrams and software setup for the Arduino IDE and WibbleWobble.
  - **Frame Sequential (Projector)**: Guidance on setting up Frame Sequential 3D for DLP and other compatible projectors. This covers Windows operating system configurations (preferring the projector as the main display) and the installation of the WibbleWobbleCore application and add-on.
