WibbleWobble is a powerful software created by the talented *PEZZALUCIFER*.

This ReShade add-on allows you to play games in a VR-like immersive way. It does this by taking a single game view and spreading it across multiple monitors, using head tracking to adjust the view. This method helps save performance. WibbleWobble supports both single-eye (monoscopic) and 3D (stereoscopic) modes, including Frame Sequential 3D. It also lets you set custom fields of view (FOVs), making it flexible and usable even without a VR headset.

To set it up, you'll need to configure OpenTrack, ReShade, and your game's specific settings. It generally works best when your game is running in windowed mode with your own custom screen layouts.

These guides will focus on setting up your ``Game``, ``Hardware``, and getting everything working, especially with most stereo 3D projectors and monitors.
