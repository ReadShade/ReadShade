PCSX2
=====

This guide shows you how to set up ReShade with the PCSX2 emulator.

Introduction to PCSX2 Settings
------------------------------

We'll use the DX11 API for this guide because it works well with other add-ons.

Display Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To find the display settings, go to the menu shown below.

#. **Fullscreen Mode & Aspect Ratio:** Set the aspect ratio to :guilabel:`Fit to Window` as shown below.

      Screenshot showing :guilabel:`Fit to Window` aspect ratio selected.

   This is important because the depth buffer is set this way internally.

#. **Anti-Blur:** Turn on this option to reduce blurry effects.

Rendering
---------

We'll use the DX11 API for rendering. You can try other APIs if they can output a depth buffer.

Rendering Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To find the rendering settings, go to the menu shown below.

#. **Rendering:** Set the rendering to :guilabel:`Direct3D 11` as shown below.

   This setting works best with most ReShade add-ons.

#. **Internal Resolution:** For most games, set the internal resolution to :guilabel:`Native`.

   This also helps ReShade's generic depth add-on work correctly.
