Further Exploration
===================

Experiment with Colors
   Try changing the ``grayscaleValue`` calculation. What happens if you only use the red component (``originalColor.r``)?

Combine Effects
   In ReShade, you can enable multiple shaders. The output of one shader becomes the input for the next.

Explore Other Shaders
   Look at the other :file:`.fx` files in your ReShade :file:`Shaders` folder (like :file:`Daltonize.fx`, :file:`Deband.fx`, :file:`DisplayDepth.fx`). Try to understand how they work by examining their ``PS_`` functions and techniques.

ReShade FX Reference
   For more advanced details, refer to the `ReShade FX Shading Language Reference <https://github.com/crosire/reshade-shaders/blob/slim/REFERENCE.md>`_

This is just the beginning! Shaders offer immense power to customize and enhance your visual experience. Have fun experimenting!
