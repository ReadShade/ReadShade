WibbleWobble is a powerful software created by the talented *PEZZALUCIFER*. This ReShade add-on allows you to experience games in a VR-like immersive way by spreading a single game view across multiple monitors and adjusting it with head tracking to save performance. WibbleWobble supports both single-eye (monoscopic) and 3D (stereoscopic) modes, including Frame Sequential 3D, and offers custom fields of view (FOVs), making it flexible even without a VR headset.

Setting up WibbleWobble involves configuring OpenTrack, ReShade, and your game's specific settings. It generally performs best when your game runs in windowed mode with custom screen layouts. These guides focus on setting up your game and hardware to work seamlessly with most stereo 3D projectors and monitors.

Key topics include:

- **Frame Sequential (Monitor)**: A detailed guide on setting up Frame Sequential 3D for monitors, including how to build an IR Emitter using an Arduino, wiring instructions, and configuring the Arduino IDE. It also covers important considerations for 3D glasses and screen polarization.
- **Frame Sequential (Projector)**: This guide helps you set up Frame Sequential 3D for projectors, primarily focusing on DLP projectors. It covers recommended display configurations, such as setting the projector as the main display and optimizing resolution, and provides instructions for installing the WibbleWobbleCore application and add-on.
