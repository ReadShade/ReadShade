Basic Guides
============

This section provides basic guides for enhancing depth effects and shader control in games using ReShade add-ons. It includes instructions on how to download and install the "Generic Depth" add-on to improve depth effects, and a detailed guide on using the "Reshade Effect Shader Toggler (R.E.S.T)" to separate game effects, apply ReShade shaders to specific parts of a game, and configure its settings, including enabling 3D shaders and isolating UI elements. Troubleshooting tips and configuration sharing are also covered for R.E.S.T.
