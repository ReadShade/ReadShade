Blurry Text, Images, Videos, Website & Games.

This is a basic guide to fix this issue:

1. The basic way to do this is to right click on the game's `.exe`.
2. Select `Properties`
3. Select the `Compatibility` tab
4. Click on `Change High DPI Settings`
5. At the Bottom check `Override high DPI scaling behavior`.
6. Open the Pulldown and pick \[Application\]

There may be a global way of doing this. But, I'm not sure that it will work the same across all modern Window OS's.
