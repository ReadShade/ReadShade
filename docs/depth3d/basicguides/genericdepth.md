## Preface

Okay, let's talk about the basics. You will need the add-on version of ReShade. [Read it here.](../../reshade/reshadeversions.md)

Then you will need to download the add-on it self [here](https://discord.com/channels/305472403977404416/1081018051526406195).

Make sure you use the correct one for your game.
