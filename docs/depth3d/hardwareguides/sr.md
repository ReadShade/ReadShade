## Important Notes

When starting the game, you may need to set your primary monitor to the Simulated Reality Display. If not, the game may not select the correct screen, resulting in a black screen.

Additionally, ensure the game is running at its native resolution for the 3D display. If the resolution is too small, the image may appear distorted.
