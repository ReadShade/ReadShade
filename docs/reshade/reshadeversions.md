# ReShade Versions and You

## So what version of ReShade should you use?

Beats me... I am kidding. But, lets find out together.

## "Am I going to play online or offline?"

The reason for this question is we need to know what the best ReShade version for you.

If it's a online game you want to use the add-on version. This version has Network Detection disabled.

> Scroll to the bottom of reshade.me and click the 2nd button.

Keep in mind you may not want to do this all the time.

In that case if you are playing a single player game then the normal version is ok to use. You also get it at the link above. Just click the first button this time.

## "Do I need a special version of ReShade for the game?"

Well in this case you need to download it from a other location.

For example, [this version of ReShade](https://discord.com/channels/305472403977404416/1160012733652148274/1221669091870244954) was made to work for Dragons Dogma 2 along side the REFramework.

> The game is single player but, I need to use a add-on.

In that case download the ReShade Version with add-on Support. You can get it [here](https://reshade.me/).

This version support almost every add-on like the ones [here](https://discord.com/channels/305472403977404416/1081018051526406195).

## "Where can I get an older version of ReShade?"

There are a few ways to do that. But, the two easy ways of doing this is downloading directly from ReShades own website. Let me show you how.

- Use this like for ReShade version Current to 3.0.0

    <https://reshade.me/downloads/ReShade_Setup_x.x.x.exe>

- Use this like for ReShade version Current to 5.0.0 and Current.

    <https://reshade.me/downloads/ReShade_Setup_6.1.1_Addon.exe>

For example I want to download a specific version of ReShade. But, it's no longer on the website. This is where I'm going to have to use the second method.

- This is the ReShade Repository

### Note

This is needed to download ReShade version 4.4.2 for Fallout, NV Fallout 3 and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.

There may be other games that needs this old version. But, one day I hope we can add support for the old games listed here in newer version of ReShade.

## "I want to play Elden Ring. It's an online game with EAC. Can I do this?"

Yes you can. Some EAC games let you play online with ReShade.

Elden Ring is one of them where the Developers allows for ReShade to be used. In this case use the Add-on version of ReShade.

But, Not every game will work like this. For example the game Lords of the Fallen will not let you launch with any version of ReShade. You will have to disable EAC if you want to use it.

If you do disable EAC, just use the add-on version at that point.
